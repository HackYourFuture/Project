# Project mentors

For the final project the students require a `tech lead` and `product owner` for 6 weeks and a `scrum master` for 3 weeks. Usually we split this into two parts (first 3 weeks and last 3 weeks). The first 3 weeks are all about building the mvp together with the students. This is a little more hands-on as this will be the first full stack application they build as a group. In the last 3 weeks the goal is to simulate a developer team with weekly sprints to have them experience what that looks like.

Below we will go into the different parts highlighting the responsibilities and time commitments per week. Weeks start on Sunday (except for week 0 which means any time before the first Sunday) and the week responsibilities are for the week after the Sunday meeting.

## Part 1 (Build the MVP)

### Tech lead
The table below gives an overview of what is expected, in the sections after that we go in deeper into what it means exactly.

| Week # | Sunday meeting             | Week responsibilities        |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0.     | -                          | Look through project github  |
| 1.     | [Agenda](/week1/README.md) | Mentor the 'backend' team    |
| 2.     | [Agenda](/week2/README.md) | Manage code/reviews          |
| 3.     | [Agenda](/week3/README.md) | Supervise code/reviews       |

In week 7 of the project the students will have a presentation to show off what they have built, to which you are obviously invited!

#### Looking through the project github
You will be invited to the class project github and will want to spend some time looking at the setup. We usually have a `dev` and `main` branch, with the `dev` branch set up as the default branch where everyone publishes towards. There will also be a very basic folder structure set up (`client` for frontend and `server` for the backend with some `README`'s). The rest is up to the class in week 1.

#### Mentoring the 'backend' team
In week 1 the class will be split up into 2 teams. The backend team has the responsibilities mentioned [here](/week1/MAKEME.md). The goal is to have a nice codebase set up with the simplest roundtrip so that when the whole team starts working on it it does not become a mess of different code styles. The team also needs to have an idea of the database schema's that you should review to make sure that they aren't walking into pitfalls.

#### Managing/supervising code reviews
In week 2 and 3 the students will start building features. This will be the first time they really work on something with these many people and it will be a little difficult at the start. We want them to learn how to do code reviews properly, and that will require a little bit of support as well as supervising. From previous experience, expect the following:

- Struggling with `code merge errors` and how to solve them correctly
- `Non-critical code reviews`. The students will still feel a little unsure about what they think is right and accept whatever the other wrote. You will need to be a little pushy to have them say what they actually think to get a better code base
- Help with getting the `main` and `dev` branch deployed to heroku so both versions are online

In week 2 we expect you to have to do some code reviews yourself (after other students have looked at it) to show them that it is fine to be critical and make sure that the start of the project is clean. In week 3 we want to start transitioning into the students handling it all themselves, but do have a look at the code that is being pushed to make sure the quality is still high.

### Product owner
The table below gives an overview of what is expected, in the sections after that we go in deeper into what it means exactly.

| Week # | Sunday meeting                                 | Week responsibilities        |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0.     | -                                              | Set up the project board     |
| 1.     | [Agenda](/week1/README.md)                     | Mentor the 'frontend' team   |
| 2.     | Facilitate meeting: [Agenda](/week2/README.md) | -                            |
| 3.     | Facilitate meeting: [Agenda](/week3/README.md) | -                            |

In week 7 of the project the students will have a presentation to show off what they have built, to which you are obviously invited!

#### Setting up the project board
You will be invited to the class project github and will want to set up the project board (`projects` tab) to how you would like to organise it. Also add an example user story to deploy the project so that the user can actually use the application. This will serve as a template for the students to make their own user stories in week 1.

#### Mentoring the 'frontend' team
In week 1 the class will be split up into 2 teams. The frontend team has the responsibilities mentioned [here](/week1/MAKEME.md). The goal is to have a nice and clear wireframe set up that can serve as a guide for the students of what to build. They will also need to decide on what is in the initial version (doable in 2 weeks). From previous experience, expect the following:

- Questions about `user stories` and how to word them. Also why we do it like this
- The inability to cut features because 'it is all needed to be useful'

#### Facilitating meetings
In week 1, the education director will facilitate the meeting as we at HYF want to get feedback from the students on things to improve in the curriculum while it is still relatively fresh. In week 2 and 3, however, it is the responsibility of the Product owner to facilitate the meetings. That means:

- Create a video conference link and share it in the class channel at 12:00
- Once everyone is there, go through the points as described in that week's agenda. If any of the points are unclear, let us know and we will help explain the goal
- After the meeting, write a message highlighting the important decisions/plan for that week so that everyone is on the same page

## Part 2 (Work as a scrum team)

### Tech lead
The table below gives an overview of what is expected, in the sections after that we go in deeper into what it means exactly.

| Week # | Sunday meeting             | Week responsibilities        |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 3.     | -                          | Look through project code    |
| 4.     | [Agenda](/week4/README.md) | Be available for questions   |
| 5.     | [Agenda](/week5/README.md) | Be available for questions   |
| 6.     | [Agenda](/week6/README.md) | Be available for questions   |

In week 7 of the project the students will have a presentation to show off what they have built, to which you are obviously invited!

#### Technical refinement
During the Sunday meetings (week 4, 5, 6) the students will be asked to do technical refinements. They haven't done it before so we expect you to have to assist a little more in the first week and then less and less as the weeks go on.

#### Looking through the project code
You will be invited to the class project github and will want to spend some time looking at the code before the first meeting. This should help you with assisting with technical refinements as well as answering any technical questions that may come up. The class will have already done 3 weeks of work on the application!

#### Be available for questions
During the week you may be asked for help if the class gets really stuck. They already have 3 weeks in them, so we expect the questions to be minimal, but you should be available at least once per day to answer anything. Let the class know the best way to reach you!

### Product Owner
The table below gives an overview of what is expected, in the sections after that we go in deeper into what it means exactly.

| Week # | Sunday meeting                                 | Week responsibilities        |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 3.     | -                                              | Check out the app, wireframes, project board  |
| 4.     | [Agenda](/week4/README.md)                     | -                            |
| 5.     | [Agenda](/week5/README.md)                     | -                            |
| 6.     | [Agenda](/week6/README.md)                     | -                            |

In week 7 of the project the students will have a presentation to show off what they have built, to which you are obviously invited!

#### Check out the app, wireframes and project board
In the first three weeks an MVP will be built for the application. During week 3, the students will be asked to share a link to a deployed version of the app, the wireframes and you will also be invited to the github project. Have a look before the first Sunday meeting to check out what the app is that is being built and what the current status is. During the Sunday meetings it is your responsibility to answer questions about how the app should work as well as what the priority is!

### Scrum Master
The table below gives an overview of what is expected, in the sections after that we go in deeper into what it means exactly.

| Week # | Sunday meeting                                 | Week responsibilities        |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 3.     | -                                              | Check out the project board  |
| 4.     | Facilitate: [Agenda](/week4/README.md)         | -                            |
| 5.     | Facilitate: [Agenda](/week5/README.md)         | -                            |
| 6.     | Facilitate: [Agenda](/week6/README.md)         | -                            |

In week 7 of the project the students will have a presentation to show off what they have built, to which you are obviously invited!

#### Check out the project board
In the first three weeks an MVP will be built for the application. During week 3, the students will be asked to share a link to a deployed version of the app, the wireframes and you will also be invited to the github project. Have a look before the first Sunday meeting to check out what the current status is. And have a look at the project board to see how it has been organised so far. Feel free to make adjustments, but if you do you have to explain them on Sunday!

### Facilitating meetings
Week 4, 5 and 6 will be facilitated by the Scrum Master. Have a look at the agenda's to see what that means exactly and if it is unclear, let us know! In week 5 and 6 we would like to have retrospectives to show the students what these are like and why they are useful. For week 6, it is important to help the students scope the last week with solely bugs and small improvements so that there is a nice looking and bugfree final version online!
