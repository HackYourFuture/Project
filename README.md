# Module #8 - Project: Build an application with a team (Full Stack)

![Project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23367061/131866344-83a11480-be48-4ca2-8a4d-948728dafe88.png)

Welcome to the Project module! Congratulations on making it this far!

In the upcoming 6 weeks you'll be immersed into the web developer life. By the end of it you and your classmates will have created your own full-stack web application and published it to the internet!

Everything you have learned so far will be combined and put into practice. We will start with deciding on an app, then building an MVP (Minimal Viable Product), and incrementally add more features afterwards. This way you'll learn how all the pieces of a full stack application are built and work together.

Along with practicing your programming skills you will also be working on your communication skills. This is just as important, because as a developer you need to be able to communicate your ideas and efforts in an easy-to-understand manner.

## Learning Goals

At the end of this module you'll have learned the following:

Technical skills:

- How to `build a complete full-stack application`
- Understanding `how each part of an application relates` to each other
- What it means to work on a `feature`
- How to work with `GIT in a team setting`
- How to write `readable code`

Communication skills:

- How to `communicate effectively` with team members
- `Keeping track` of your project's progress
- Knowing if you `understand what's asked` of you
- How to `communicate with non-developers` about what you're doing
- Learning how to be `solutions-oriented`
- How to work in an `Agile setting`

## After the Project

Congratulations, you finished the Project module and got a working full stack application online to show off to potential employers! Copy the code over to your personal github, fill in the README and go through the code to make sure you understand how it all fits together. This is also the time you can make adjustments to the code base you didn't have time to do during the project itself. Have a look at the [technical assignment guidelines](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/ta_guidelines#6-prepare-the-repository) to see how you should fill in the README.

## General assessment

After the final presentation the HYF Core will do a general assessment interview with you. This is a mock social and technical interview with two members of the HYF core team. The HYF core team in these interviews will determine if you are ready to interview for junior developer positions. If that is the case, you will officially graduate and we will start sending your CV's to companies! Expect a lot of interviews and technical assignments coming your way!

If not, do not panic. We will sit down with you to see where more work is needed. As long as you put in the effort, we will continue to support you.

For more information, have a look at the [general assessment section](./week7/MAKEME.md) and do not forget to read the [Graduation Interviews Repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation/blob/main/graduation_Interviews.md) to be as prepared as you can be!
