# Product owner

As the product owner, it is your role to decide on the priority of the different features the team will be building. There is not a lot of time, but we do want a functional application in the end so prioritising the right things is extremely important.

Below you will find an overview of what is expected of you every week. The weeks start on Sunday with a full team meeting and last until the next Saturday.

| Week # | Sunday meeting                           | Week responsibilities                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1.     | Guide team through initial user stories  | Support the team in making user stories |
| 2.     | Determine priority                       | -                                       |
| 3.     | Determine priority / validate user demos | -                                       |
| 4.     | Determine priority / validate user demos | -                                       |

Below we will explain each task in more detail.

## Guide team through initial user stories

In the first kickoff meeting in week 1 we will only have an app idea which needs to be fleshed out. It is up to the Product Owner to facilitate this process of brainstorming to get to a list of user stories that are in and out of the scope for this application. The end product should be a list of user stories that the team can design an app with pages/buttons/designs around during the first week of the project.

How you want to facilitate this is up to you, there is no right or wrong way, as long as the end product is reached. If you want some suggestions then let us know.

## Supporting the team in making user stories

In week 1 the class will have a deliverable of having user stories set up. The goal is to have a nice and clear wireframe set up that can serve as a guide for the students of what to build. They will also need to decide on what is in the initial version (doable in 2 weeks). From previous experience, expect the following:

- Questions about `user stories` and how to word them
- The inability to cut features because 'it is all needed to be useful'

## Determine priority

During the sprint planning it is your job to determine which user stories are the most important to fulfil during the upcoming week to end up with a working project.

## Validate user demos

During the sprint demo it is your job to determine if the built solution solves the user story or that there are some extra steps needed that require a new ticket.

## Determine final issues to fix

In the last week we want to focus on finalising the MVP and that means making sure all of the inconsistencies/bugs/placeholder buttons are cleaned up. It is your job to keep the team from taking on too much in this last week. It is better to have a clean small product than a messy big one.
