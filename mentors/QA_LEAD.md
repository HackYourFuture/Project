# QA lead

As the QA lead, it is your role to make sure the code is production ready. The end product is going to be the main project on the CVs of our students and as such should have clean code. You are also there to help them if they get stuck and teach them about the importance of code reviews.

Below you will find an overview of what is expected of you every week. The weeks start on Sunday with a full team meeting and last until the next Saturday.

Below we will explain each task in more detail.

## Help think of user stories

In the first kickoff meeting in week 1 we will only have an app idea which needs to be fleshed out. As part of the team you will assist in the thinking of user stories and help brainstorming.

## Support the team in making the test plan

In week 1 the class will be given a deliverable to create a test plan for the app, have a look at the description [here](/week1/MAKEME.md). The goal is to have this set up and explained to the whole team so that the team is on the same page. They may need some assistance for this, so make sure to keep an eye on slack whenever they ask a question.

## Plan weekly QA meeting for questions

We would like you to plan a weekly meeting that fits in your schedule outside of the Sunday meeting for students to ask specific questions about anything QA related. It is up to you when to plan these, but we find that it is important for students to be able to ask questions during the week to avoid them going into a different path.
