# Project mentors

For the final project the team consists of a `tech lead`, a `QA lead` a `product owner` and a `scrum master`. The goal of the project is to build an mvp of an app together with the students that they can show off on their CVs. This will not only show them how a full stack application works, but also how an agile team operates and why this has become the standard way of organising development teams. After the project our students will start internships at companies and we would like them to be prepared for professional life in The Netherlands.

For a better explanation of what each role is responsible for and what we expect, have a look at:
