Below we will explain each task in more detail.

## Help think of user stories

In the first kickoff meeting in week 1 we will only have an app idea which needs to be fleshed out. As part of the team you will assist in the thinking of user stories and help brainstorming.

## Facilitate meeting

From week 2 on, you are responsible for facilitating the meetings on Sunday. Go through the agenda and make sure that the steps are followed. You can use whatever tools you want to facilitate it using your experience as a scrum master, just make sure it is open for anyone to use!

It is also your responsibility to start the meeting on Sunday by providing a link to a video conferencing meeting in the class channel on Sunday at 12:00.
