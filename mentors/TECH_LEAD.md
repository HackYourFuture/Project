# Tech lead

As the Tech lead, it is your role to make sure the code is production ready. The end product is going to be the main project on the CVs of our students and as such should have clean code. You are also there to help them if they get stuck and teach them about the importance of code reviews.

Below you will find an overview of what is expected of you every week. The weeks start on Sunday with a full team meeting and last until the next Saturday.

| Week # | Sunday meeting                 | Week responsibilities                                           |

Below we will explain each task in more detail.

## Help think of user stories

In the first kickoff meeting in week 1 we will only have an app idea which needs to be fleshed out. As part of the team you will assist in the thinking of user stories and help brainstorming.

## Support the team in making the ERD

In week 1 the class will be given a deliverable to create an ERD for the basic app, have a look at the description [here](/week1/MAKEME.md). The goal is to have a nice idea of the database schemas that the app will need that you should review to make sure that they aren't walking into pitfalls.

## Help with technical refinement

During the Sprint Planning, the students are asked to do a technical refinement. As a more experienced developer you will notice that they will probably forget some things. Assist them when these things are forgotten by asking questions.

## Plan weekly tech meeting for questions

We would like you to plan a weekly meeting that fits in your schedule outside of the Sunday meeting for students to ask specific technical questions. If you are unable to do this because of any reason, then let the Education Director know and they will schedule a meeting with the students.

## Managing/supervising code reviews

In week 2 and 3 the students will be building features. This will be the first time they really work on something with this many people and it will be a little difficult at the start. We want them to learn how to do code reviews properly, and that will require a little bit of support as well as supervising. From previous experience, expect the following:

- Struggling with `code merge errors` and how to solve them correctly
- `Non-critical code reviews`. The students will still feel a little unsure about what they think is right and accept whatever the other wrote. You will need to be a little pushy to have them say what they actually think to get a better code base.

In week 2 we expect you to have to do some code reviews yourself (after other students have looked at it) to show them that it is fine to be critical and make sure that the start of the project is clean. In week 3 we want to start transitioning into the students handling it all themselves, but do have a look at the code that is being pushed to make sure the quality is still high. After that they are on their own.
