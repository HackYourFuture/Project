# QA pre project

If you are following the QA track then you will have some extra theory to go through before you can fulfil your role in the project. You will be taken out of the main curriculum two weeks before the project starts and under guidance of a qa mentor go through the materials provided below. During the project you will continue building your knowledge with weekly theory, but you will already be able to get practical experience during the project.
