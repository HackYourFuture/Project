These are the topics for week 1:

- What is Software testing?
- Fundamentals of testing
- QA Engineer Mindset
- Testing Pyramid

### What is Software testing?

Most of us use airplanes and cars. Would you ride in a car or take a seat on an airplane if you knew these vehicles were not tested? Would you feel safe and secure? Itâ€™s human nature to avoid risks if possible. To understand the value of testing you need to what is software testing in the first place ..

> Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software product or service under test. Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation.

### Fundamentals of testing

Now that we know what it is, let's look at a global overview of the fundamentals of testing and your role as a QA engineer. How to determine what parts of the application to monitor and how to communicate the health of the application. Go through the following course:

### QA Engineer Mindset

What makes QAs valuable is their mindset! A mindset is a set of assumptions, methods, or notations held by one or more person. In simple words ... it's the way of thinking. As a QA engineer having the right mindset is the key to ensure quality.

> A tester's mind should be like that of a child. Someone who is curious, unbiased and not afraid to ask the stupidest of questions .

### Testing Pyramid

In the previous week, you read about the common types of testing. To build on that, the testing pyramid puts these methods into a diagram, which indicates what kind of testing will be more valuable at which stage.

> The "Test Pyramid" is a metaphor that tells us to group software tests into buckets of different granularity. It also gives an idea of how many tests we should have in each of these groups
