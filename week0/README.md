# Plan week 0

During the project we are moving to a Sunday - Saturday week schedule instead of the Wednesday - Tuesday week schedule we have been using during the curriculum. To facilitate that we call the time in between the last Tuesday of the previous module and the first Sunday of the project 'week 0'.

## Agenda
1. Think of app ideas!
2. New technologies/concepts
    - [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
    - [Database seeding](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/dbmgmt/seeds.html)
    - [Software Development LifeCycle](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/software-development/SDLC)
3. Quick refreshers
    - [Agile/Scrum](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/software-development/agile)
    - Git branching

## Goals
On the first Sunday meeting we will be deciding on the app to build. To give you the full development experience we are going to build something from scratch so you are there to see how an app goes from just a single README to a full application! And you get to decide what that application will be! There should be a thread in the class channel where everyone can post their ideas, post your own and read through what others have decided. The project will be a prominent piece on your CV and you will be working on it for at least 7 weeks so make it something you like working on!

For the project we are going to use much of the knowledge you have gained over the curriculum, but as a developer we want to keep learning so we will be adding some more things as well. Have a look at the [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) package as we will be using it to work in mongoDB, but have some aspects of the relational way of building databases built in! Besides that we will be using a concept called [Database seeding](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/dbmgmt/seeds.html), which will be critical when working on a bigger application. Lastly we will be using a simple version of the [SDLC](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/software-development/SDLC) to make sure that we manage our application well. Have a look at these concepts and do your own research to be prepared to use them.

Besides that it has been a while since we have done a group project so refresh your mind on what [Agile/Scrum](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/software-development/agile) is and how to work with Git in a team (as learned in the HTML/CSS/Git and Browsers modules).
