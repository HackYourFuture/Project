# Plan week 0

During the project we are moving to a Sunday - Saturday week instead of the Wednesday - Tuesday week we have been using during the curriculum. To facilitate that we call the time in between the last Tuesday of the previous module and the first Sunday of the project 'week 0'.

## Agenda
1. Think of app ideas!
2. New technologies/concepts
    - [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
    - [Database seeding](TODO)
    - [Software Development LifeCycle](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/software-development/SDLC)
3. Quick refreshers
    - [Agile/Scrum](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/software-development/agile)
    - Git branching

## Goals
On Sunday we will be deciding on the app to build. To get you the full development experience we are going to build something from scratch! It is up to you to give suggestions on what to build. There should be a thread in the class channel where everyone can post their ideas, post your own and read through what others have decided. The project will be a prominent piece on your CV and you will be working on it for at least 7 weeks so make it something you like working on!

TODO: mongoose explanation

Besides that it has been a while since we have done a group project so refresh your mind on what [Agile/Scrum](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/software-development/agile) is and how to work with Git in a team (as learned in the HTML/CSS/Git and Browsers modules).
