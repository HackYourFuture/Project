# Week 1

From now on you as a class are an agile development team. One of the key points of these teams is that you, as a group, will be responsible for delivering everything mentioned below. So don't see it as you splitting off to do just your tasks, but as a team you have to decide the best way to get everything done. This is how it will work in the real world as well, where at the start of a `sprint` it will be decided what can be done by the team collectively, rather than what each individual will do.

That means that you will want to divide some tasks, but get together daily to check in and make sure everyone stays on the same page. For each deliverable, remember that they need to be presented at the end of the week to the mentor team.

# Week tasks:

- 1. App design
- 2. (Dev) Entity Relationship Diagram
- 3. (QA) Create test plan

## 1. App design

All applications start with an idea, but an idea does not get you very far. To work out application ideas we generally start with wireframes. These are a representation of all the pages the application will have without adding any design layers yet. This allows everyone to talk through the application and already figure out the user experience without having to code anything. After the key user challenges are solved in the wireframes, a design layer can be added.

To create app design we suggest using [figma](https://www.figma.com) as it allows you to easily build and share the app design as well as collaborate on them in real time. They also have design templates that you can use to make the app look good!

The app design you make will become the basis for building features in the next 6 weeks, so make sure that they are clear and self explanatory.

On Sunday, one of you will present the app design to the team. If you need help with this or are stuck, your product owner is the person to contact.

## 2. (Dev) Entity Relationship Diagram

An Entity Relationship Diagram is a visual representation of how the database will be set up and you've learned about them in the database module. By thinking out the database structure and having a diagram with named models that everyone can refer to it will be much easier to communicate with each other. In the project you will be using [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) which will bridge the gap between relational and document-based databases by providing schema's that the documents have to adhere too. By having the diagram, implementing these schema's will also become a lot easier.

On Sunday, one of you will present this diagram to the team. If you need help with this or are stuck, your tech lead is the person to contact.

## 3. (QA) Create test plan

During the preproject materials you learned about test plans. While you are working on the app design, also have a think about what the plan is going to be to test this application so that it will be a quality prduct in the end.

On Sunday, one of you will present this test plan to the team. If you need help with this or are stuck, your qa lead is the person to contact.
