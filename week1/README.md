## 1. What's a full-stack application?

A full-stack application is software that consists of both a frontend (a user interface) and a backend (web server + database). The `full-stack` refers to the technologies used to make both of these.

There are many different, popular stacks out there. Currently, the biggest ones for web development are:

- MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js & Node.js)
- MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
- Django stack (Python, Django and MySQL)

When building an application, it's important to choose the right technologies for the job. The collection of technologies chosen is what we refer to as a `tech stack`.

### Design vs. implementation

Let's say you want to build a house. One approach of doing so is just starting and laying down bricks. Another is to first come up with a blueprint and think out how you would like things to look like.

These two approaches, respectively, basically come down to `design` and `implementation`. When you design software, you're thinking about **architecture** (what components are involved and how they will relate to each other). When you implement software, you're thinking about **problem solving** (how to write logic that works and integrate it into the rest of the system).

> As a junior developer you'll mostly work on software implementation, but if you want to aspire to be a senior developer you need to start studying software design!

### The full-stack developer

A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software. This usually means that you are knowledgable and skilled at technologies that are used on either side and know how to integrate them.

In the HackYourFuture program you learned mostly about frontend related technology, with the bare minimum of backend (Node.js, MySQL) to understand the full stack.

You probably know all of this already, but it doesn't hurt to refresh your knowledge!

## 2. Software development methodologies

Being a developer means much more than just writing code. It means **working in teams** in order to build something bigger than you could by yourself. As you can imagine, this will introduce a lot of complexity in your work!

In order to (1) make communicating with your colleagues easier and (2) work in an efficient way, we have to work within a certain protocol. How will we do so? By using what's called a `software development methodology`.

A software development methodology has little to do with programming. Instead, it focuses on **communication** and **organization**: how should you organise your team, your development process and roles in order to deliver as much value as you can give?

### History

In order to properly understand what we're doing right now, it's useful to know something about it's history and development over time. Software development methodologies are no different.

To learn more, go through the following:

- [A Brief History of Software Development Methodologies](https://intetics.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-software-development-methodologies)

## Different methodologies

There are different ways of working within software development. The biggest methodologies out there at the moment are:

- Waterfall
- Agile
- Lean
- Extreme programming

Each methodology, similar to a programming language, has been built (and should be used!) for a specific purpose.

For example, the Waterfall methodology is used for clearly defined projects with definitive timelines and well-defined deliverables. In these projects it doesn't matter if the market changes, because the end result will always be received the same.

However, the Agile methodology handles projects where the major constraints are not well understood. For instance, if your project involves the development of a new product, the scope and timeline may be difficult to define in advance.
