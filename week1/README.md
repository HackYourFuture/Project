## 1. What's a full-stack application?

A full-stack application is software that consists of both a frontend (a user interface) and a backend (web server + database). The `full-stack` refers to the technologies used to make both of these.

### Design vs. implementation

### The full-stack developer

## 2. Software development methodologies

Being a developer means much more than just writing code. It means **working in teams** in order to build something bigger than you could by yourself. As you can imagine, this will introduce a lot of complexity in your work!

In order to (1) make communicating with your colleagues easier and (2) work in an efficient way, we have to work within a certain protocol. How will we do so? By using what's called a `software development methodology`.

### History

In order to properly understand why we're doings right now, it's useful to know something about it's history and development over time. Software development methodologies are no different.
