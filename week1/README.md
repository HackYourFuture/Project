## Week goals

The start of the project requires a lot of decision making, which will be the focus for this week. We will first decide on the app idea and then with the help of our product owner work on going through the user challenges. This will give us a nice list of initial user stories to develop further throughout the week. These user stories will also provide the basis to decide on our database structure.

This week we also want to get familiar with the base repo and the environment you will be coding in. You should already have been given a day and time of a session that will go through the repo/structure and allow for questions to be asked. In that meeting we will go over the following points, but make sure you go through the repo beforehand (the `README` also offers a lot of information already):

- The stack and all the libraries that will be used
- The folder structure of both the `client` and the `server`
- The code style decisions
- How the CI/CD pipeline is set up and what checks are run automatically
