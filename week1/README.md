# Week 1

## Sunday meeting
On Sunday our agenda will look as follows:

*12:00 - 12:30* Discuss curriculum, give feedback to us at HYF
*12:30 - 13:00* Go over the learning goals and schedule of the project
*13:00 - 13:15* BREAK

## Week goals
The start of the project requires a lot of decision making, which this week will be about. As you can see in the agenda the class will be divided up into teams just for this week: The 'backend' team and the 'frontend' team. The names are in quotation marks as some responsibilities are not technically something that only the backend or frontend developers are responsible for. But the 'backend' team will be more responsible for making technical choices whereas the 'frontend' team will be more responsible for making application choices.
