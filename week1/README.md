## Week goals
The start of the project requires a lot of decision making, which will be the focus for this week. We will first decide on the app idea and then, the class will be divided up into teams: The 'backend' team and the 'frontend' team. The names are in quotation marks as some responsibilities are not technically something that only the backend or frontend developers are responsible for. But the 'backend' team will be more responsible for making technical choices whereas the 'frontend' team will be more responsible for making application choices. 

This team division will only be for this week, so it is not the case that if you go 'backend' this week you will only be building the backend. When you start building features you will be building both the backend and the frontend. You are a full stack developer!
