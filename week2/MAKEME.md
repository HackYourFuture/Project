# Week 2 tasks
This week you are in a feature pair or threesome that is responsible for finishing the feature of that week. You will also be responsible for providing code reviews to the other teams whenever they request it. This is a big part of being a developer!

> This week, the mentors will be a little more available than normal to help get a good start. The education director will also be at the meetings to make sure that everything is going well and/or answer any questions about what to do in certain situations. This is only for this week, during the next week(s) the amount of support will get lowered until you can do it all yourselves.

Have a look at the [tips](../TIPS.md) for a successful project.

## Daily meeting organiser
If you are the daily meeting organiser you have an extra task this week. Every day on the time decided on Sunday it is up to you to share a link to a video conference. To facilitate the meeting, have every team answer the following questions:

- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are you blocked?

Avoid vague answers like 'I worked on my feature' or 'I will fix a bug' as that doesn't help anyone. The goal is to give everyone an idea of where you are or what you are going to do so that everyone can place the code you write or even give tips. 

For example, if someone says that they are going to build a context today to provide multiple components with access to the logged in user name, someone else may say that if they could add the e-mail to the context as well it would help out with their feature. 

Remember that a sprint is a team game and it will help you so much to understand the code base if you have an idea what everyone is working on.

If someone is blocked, it is time to figure out how to unblock them. If they are waiting for another team to finish, the other team may need to shift priorities or already push part of their code to allow the first to continue. If they are stuck on some problem, it is up to the whole group to decide who is needed to help fix the problem and reprioritize the tasks for the day.
