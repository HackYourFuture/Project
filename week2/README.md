## Week goals

This is the first week of actually starting to build. There will be some startup issues, but your mentors are here to help you so please contact them if you have questions. Do _not_ wait until the next Sunday meeting to ask questions, you are expected to have already finished the features by then and present it to the group.

For extra support in the first week, the education director will also be there during the daily meetings, but the daily meeting organiser is responsible for facilitating it.
