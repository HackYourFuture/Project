### Discussions

This week's meeting will have 3 discussions: App design, database structure and the test plan. For each, the students will do a presentation on what they came up with that week and the rest can give feedback and possibly decide on some last minute adjustments.

### Sprint planning

Every week from now on you will be doing a sprint planning. This includes the following steps:

- Decide on which user stories to tackle the upcoming week
- Determine the acceptance criteria of the user story
- Determine the steps needed to build it (Technical Refinement step)
- Use planning poker to determine the amount of points for this user story
- Divide the group into pairs and decide who will start with which user story
- Determine a daily meeting organiser (rotates every week)

#### Technical Refinement step

From this week on you will be asked to do a technical refinement step on Sunday. Per feature we want to build a student will be asked to explain the technical steps needed to be implemented. Think about things like:

- Do I need to do some research about some new concept?
- Does the database model need to be changed?
- Does there need to be a new endpoint? Or does an existing endpoint need to be changed?
- What needs to happen on the frontend? Will new components be made?
- Will a context be needed? A custom hook?

This refinement will help you through the week, but it will also help make an `estimation` of how big the issue is. This estimation will allow for better planning by the product owner and is an important step in any sprint planning.

## Week goals

This is the first week of actually starting to build. There will be some startup issues, but your mentors are here to help you so please contact them if you have questions. Do _not_ wait until the next Sunday meeting to ask questions, you are expected to have already finished the features by then and present it to the group.

For extra support in the first week, the education director will also be there during the daily meetings, but the daily meeting organiser is responsible for facilitating it.
