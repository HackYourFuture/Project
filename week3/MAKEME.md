# Week 3 tasks
This week will be very similar to the previous one. You are in a feature pair or threesome that is responsible for finishing the feature of that week. Next to that you are also responsible for providing code reviews to the other teams whenever they request it.

If you are the daily meeting organiser then look at the [week 2 tasks](../week2/README.md) to see what that entails.

Remember the [tips](../TIPS.md) to a successful developer team!

## Preparing the mentor swap
In the next Sunday meeting a new mentor team will take over (sometimes we find mentors that do the whole project, but that is rare). They will need to be informed on the state of the project. To make this process run smoothly, as a team make sure that the following is done:

- There is a link to, and an explanation of, the wireframes in the class channel so the new product owner can have a look. Make it important to also write down the elevator pitch! What makes this application different? What is the end goal?
- There is a link to the deployed latest version of the application. This will allow the new team to know the current state of the project.
