# Homework Final Project Week 1

## Agenda

1. Video Course
2. Record a concept

## 1. Video Course

You're halfway there!

Once again, you are required to go through the course for 1/4 of its length (or to whatever section your mentor tasks you).

While doing so, you have to code along and make sure to store the code in a personal repository on GitHub.

If any things are unclear, write down those questions! You can ask them during the Q&A on Sunday to your classmates and teacher!

## 2. Record a concept

In order to pass job interviews you need to be able to explain concepts clearly.

In this weekly homework you should make a video (using screen capture) in which you explain 1 programming concept.

Here are the requirements you have to fulfill:

- A general high level explanation of the concept: how + why
- A self-written code example that you analyse and explain step-by-step
- The application of the concept to the project you're building
- The video should include both your screen and your webcam view (we want to see your face!)
- It should be around 5 minutes

We recommend using the following software: [Open Broadcast Software](https://obsproject.com/)
Here's a tutorial to learn how to set it up: [How to setup OBS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL8BwstqiqE)

Your teacher will assign to you which concept that should be, so please send them a Slack message!
