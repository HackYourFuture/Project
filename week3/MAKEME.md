# Week 3 tasks

This week will be very similar to the previous one and you will have the same tasks, so have a look at the tasks [here](../week2/MAKEME.md).

If you are the daily meeting organiser then look at the [week 2 tasks](../week2/MAKEME.md) to see what that entails.

If you are in the QA team then look at the [week 2 QA explanation](../week2/MAKEME.md) to see what that entails.

# Week specific tasks:

Besides the normal 'working' tasks, this week has the following specific tasks:

- 1. Preparing the mentor swap
- 2. Definition of Ready and Definition of Done
- 3. (QA) Theory
  - Mobile vs Desktop

## 1. Preparing the mentor swap

In the next Sunday meeting a new mentor team will take over (sometimes we find mentors that do the whole project, but that is rare). They will need to be informed on the state of the project. To make this process run smoothly, as a team make sure that the following is done:

- There is a link to, and an explanation of, the wireframes in the class channel so the new product owner can have a look. Make it important to also write down the elevator pitch! What makes this application different? What is the end goal?
- There is a link to the deployed latest version of the application. This will allow the new team to know the current state of the project.

## 2. Definition of Ready and Definition of Done

Until now we have worked Agile, but in a little more haphazard way. From next week we are going into a more structured Agile workflow where a scrum master will be joining the team to make sure everything goes according to plan. One of the things that will be discussed are the Definition of Ready and Definition of Done.

In agile environment, for a team to pick up a task for development it has to be _ready_. The level of readness differes from one team to another. Definition of Ready (DoR) is the minimum conditions a task must meet before it will be considered ‘Ready to be worked on’.

Now let's consider DoR is met, and the team starts working on the task, when is a task considered done? is it when the developer is done with the coding part? or when the task is validated? is the code reviewed? is documentation required? does this task affect other teams and they need to be aware of it?
The answers to those questions and more will define when a task is _done_ ... and that's the Definition of Done (DoD)

## 3. (QA) Theory

Until now you have probably focused the testing a lot on the desktop version of the application, but in the current world we need to always be aware that every website can be accessed from a mobile device as well. Have a look at the theory for this week to learn about how to approach this.

### 3.1 Desktop vs. Mobile

Mobile Apps are a part of our daily routine. Any application that can run on a handheld or mobile device (like a smartphone or tablet) with a function of providing a service to its users is categorized as a mobile application. Is testing mobile application different from web or desktop application ?
