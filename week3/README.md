# Week 3

## Sunday meeting

On Sunday our agenda will look as follows:

| Time        | Activity             |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| 12:00-12:45 | Sprint Demo          |
| 12:45-13:15 | Sprint Retrospective |
| 13:15-13:30 | BREAK                |
| 13:30-14:15 | Sprint Planning      |

### Sprint Demo

After a week of development every user story in the sprint should be finished. It is then time to show to the rest of the company what has been built and this is what we call a Sprint Demo. In our case we want to show our mentors what has been built as they are not embedded into the team (usually they would be). So make sure beforehand you know who is going to present which user story and have it prepared.

### Sprint Retrospective

The sprint retrospective is held after every sprint and the first one will be held today. The retrospective is a look back over the sprint to see what went well, what did not and what can be done about it. By doing a retrospective the team can identify processes to improve the way the team is working! Don't be afraid to be a little negative or nitpicky here, that is the only way to improve as a team!

## Week goals

This is the second week of actually starting to build. At this point the codebase should be forming nicely and you already have some experience of working together and getting things done. At the end of this week, the hope is to have a usable albeit minimal application online to be used.

At this point your tech lead will only supervise the code reviews, which means the quality of the code is now in your hands! Also, you will be doing the daily standups on your own from now on.
