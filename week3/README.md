## Week goals

This is the second week of actually starting to build. At this point the codebase should be forming nicely and you already have some experience of working together and getting things done. At the end of this week, the hope is to have a usable albeit minimal application online to be used.

At this point your tech lead will only supervise the code reviews, which means the quality of the code is now in your hands! Also, you will be doing the daily standups on your own from now on.
