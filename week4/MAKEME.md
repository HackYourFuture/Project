# Week 4 tasks
This week is again a 'build your feature' week. You are in a feature pair or threesome that is responsible for finishing the feature of that week. Next to that you are also responsible for providing code reviews to the other teams whenever they request it.

If you are the daily meeting organiser then look at the [week 2 tasks](../week2/README.md) to see what that entails.

Remember the [tips](../TIPS.md) to a successful developer team!

## Preparing for the retrospective
Keep in mind that at the end of the week you will have a retrospective. If during the week you encounter something that really helped you, or hindered you, then write it down somewhere. In the retrospective you will be asked the following questions:

- What went well?
- What can we improve?

This can be in relation to the team, the way of working, the technologies used, etc. Anything that needs to be highlighted!
