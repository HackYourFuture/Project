# Week 4 tasks

This week will be very similar to the previous one and you will have the same tasks, so have a look at the tasks [here](../week2/MAKEME.md).

If you are the daily meeting organiser then look at the [week 2 tasks](../week2/MAKEME.md) to see what that entails.

If you are in the QA team then look at the [week 2 QA explanation](../week2/MAKEME.md) to see what that entails.

Remember the [tips](../TIPS.md) to a successful developer team!

# Week specific tasks:

Besides the normal 'working' tasks, this week has the following specific tasks:

- 1. Preparing for the retrospective
- 2. (QA) Theory
  - Exploratory testing
  - Debriefing

## 1. Preparing for the retrospective

Keep in mind that at the end of the week you will have a retrospective as that is a part of every agile team. The goal of the retrospective is to look at the way the team is working and identify the positive and negative parts of it. Then, as a team, adjustments to the way of working can be made to make everyone

If during the week you encounter something that really helped you, or hindered you, then write it down somewhere. In the retrospective you will be asked the following questions:

- What went well?
- What can we improve?

This can be in relation to the team, the way of working, the technologies used, etc. Anything that needs to be highlighted!

## 2. (QA) Theory

This week we will be focusing on the topic of exploratory testing and the subsequent debriefing of it. This week there is also a practical side, it is up to you to do an exploratory testing session on your own and then plan a debriefing session with your QA lead to practice this!

### 2.1 Exploratory Testing

> It is a type of software testing where test cases are not created in advance but testers check system on the fly. They may note down ideas about what to test before test execution. The focus of exploratory testing is more on testing as a "thinking" activity.
> Exploratory Testing is widely used in Agile models and is all about discovery, investigation, and learning. It emphasizes personal freedom and responsibility of the individual tester.

### 2.2 Debriefing

Communicating your testing results is as important as testing itself, after running exploratiry testing a debriefing session is necessarily
