## Week goals

From this week on a new mentor team will be taking over and we will be adding a Scrum Master to the team. In week 1 you have read about what they are responsible for and they will be facilitating the Sunday meetings from now on. This will add two things, the technical refinement and the sprint retrospective.

## Technical refinement

From this week on you will be asked to do a technical refinement step on Sunday. Per feature we want to build a student will be asked to explain the technical steps needed to be implemented. Think about things like:

- Do I need to do some research about some new concept?
- Does the database model need to be changed?
- Does there need to be a new endpoint? Or does an existing endpoint need to be changed?
- What needs to happen on the frontend? Will new components be made?
- Will a context be needed? A custom hook?

This refinement will help you through the week, but it will also help make an `estimation` of how big the issue is. This estimation will allow for better planning by the product owner!

## Sprint retrospective

The sprint retrospective is held after every sprint and the first one will be held next week. The retrospective is a look back over the sprint to see what went well, what did not and what can be done about it. By doing a retrospective the team can identify processes to improve the way the team is working!
