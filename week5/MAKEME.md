# Week 5 tasks
This week is a 'build your feature' week as usual. You are in a feature pair or threesome that is responsible for finishing the feature of that week. Next to that you are also responsible for providing code reviews to the other teams whenever they request it.

If you are the daily meeting organiser then look at the [week 2 tasks](../week2/README.md) to see what that entails.

Remember the [tips](../TIPS.md) to a successful developer team!
