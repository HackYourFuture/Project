# Week 5 tasks

This week will be very similar to the previous one and you will have the same tasks, so have a look at the tasks [here](../week2/MAKEME.md).

If you are the daily meeting organiser then look at the [week 2 tasks](../week2/MAKEME.md) to see what that entails.

If you are in the QA team then look at the [week 2 QA explanation](../week2/MAKEME.md) to see what that entails.

Remember the [tips](../TIPS.md) to a successful developer team!

# Week specific tasks:

Besides the normal 'working' tasks, this week has the following specific tasks:

1. Preparing for the retrospective
2. (QA) Theory
   - BBD / TDD / ATDD
   - ISTBQ

## 1. Preparing for the retrospective

Keep in mind that at the end of the week you will have a retrospective. If during the week you encounter something that really helped you, or hindered you, then write it down somewhere. In the retrospective you will be asked the following questions:

- What went well?
- What can we improve?

This can be in relation to the team, the way of working, the technologies used, etc. Anything that needs to be highlighted!

## 2. (QA) Theory

This week for the QA theory we are going to talk about abbreviations in testing. We will start with development methods that teams can use to approach testing. You may have naturally already gravitated to one way of working, but now you will learn the name of it. We will also introduce you to the ISTBQ, which is the organisation that provides the standard in testing.

### 2.1 BDD/TDD/ATDD

In the agile world, testers need to collaborate and work together with developers, non-technical roles (like Product Owners and Business Analysts) and provide continuous feedback. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (TDD) are different testing methods or practices adopted by the team to facilitate the collaboration and continuous feedback. Each method has benefits and serves a specific purpose.

More details on BDD, TDD and ATDD covered by the following resources:

- [Behavior-Driven Development](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/behavior-driven-development/collaboration-with-behavior-driven-development-bdd)
- [BDD in JavaScript](https://www.sitepoint.com/bdd-javascript-cucumber-gherkin/)
- [What does TDD mean for me, the Tester?](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/the-testing-planet-archive/lessons/what-does-tdd-mean-for-me-the-tester)
- [Is Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) Worth the Effort?](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/is-acceptance-test-driven-development-atdd-worth-the-effort)
- [BDD vs TDD vs ATDD : Key Differences](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/tdd-vs-bdd-vs-atdd)

Have a think about how the team is working at the moment and see if it is applying one of these methods.

### 2.2 ISTQB

From _Wikipedia_

> The International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) is a software testing certification board that operates internationally. ISTQB Certified Tester is a standardized qualification for software testers and the certification is offered by the ISTQB.

> ISTQB streams focus on:
>
> - Core – these modules correspond to the “historical” ISTQB certifications
> - Agile – these modules address testing practices specifically for the Agile SDLC
> - Specialist – these modules are new in the ISTQB product portfolio and address specific

ISTQB Foundation Level syllabus stated the principles of software testing, read about them here :

- [7 Principles of Software Testing](https://www.toolsqa.com/software-testing/principles-of-software-testing/)

This site also offers a lot of other information about testing from the standard! So in the next few weeks/months, make sure to keep going back to see what else is out there that is out of scope for our curriculum.
