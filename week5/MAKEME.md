# Week 6 tasks

This week is a little different. You've now experienced how it is to work in a development team and it is time to refocus on getting that job. That means that this week is focused on making the project something that is CV worthy.

# Week tasks:

This week's tasks in a row:

- 1. Clean up!
- 2. Final presentation
- 3. (QA) Theory
  - BDD/TDD/ATDD
  - Automation best practices
- 4. General Assessment

## 1. Clean up!

Working as a group under pressure will always create some things that are not optimal. In the business we call that `technical debt` and it is time to clean some of that up. In the meeting on Sunday you have created a list of things to work on! As there is nothing assigned, it is important to communicate with each other what you are working on so that work is only done once.

During clean up you will probably also encounter some more problems in the code/app as you now take a closer look. Remember the tip to keep your PRs small and focused so if you encounter something, try not to fix it in the same PR but add it to the list to fix later. That way every PR has one focus and is easy to review.

## 2. Final presentation

Everyone who has helped you on the project would love to see what it has become in the end, so on the last Sunday you will hold a presentation to show it off. The guidelines for the presentation are:

- The presentation should be 15 - 20 mins long. Quality over quantity!
- In addition to being informational, make it fun!
- It’s up to you to choose who will be featured in the presentation. But make sure 3 people get to speak.
- Use slides to support your presentation. Make sure the order is logical and the buildup makes sense for outsiders. The slides should contain only a few keywords and images are highly appreciated.

The structure of the presentation needs to be as follows:

- Demo: Introduce the team, showing the UX of the frontend
- Technical accomplishments: Show the technologies used, what were some of the technological challenges and how did you solve them. The challenge here is to make it as specific as possible. Choose 1 or 2 examples in the application. Ask your mentor for help if needed.
- Social accomplishments: how did you work in groups, what worked well and what didn’t, what were some of the challenges in the project? Again, please be as specific as possible!

After the presentation, you will probably get some questions about how it went, what worked and what did not, etc. Anyone in the class can answer these questions, not just the people doing the presentation!

## 3. (QA) Theory

This week we will have some extra QA theory and we are going to talk about abbreviations in testing. We will start with development methods that teams can use to approach testing. You may have naturally already gravitated to one way of working, but now you will learn the name of it. We will also look into

### 3.1 BDD/TDD/ATDD

In the agile world, testers need to collaborate and work together with developers, non-technical roles (like Product Owners and Business Analysts) and provide continuous feedback. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (TDD) are different testing methods or practices adopted by the team to facilitate the collaboration and continuous feedback. Each method has benefits and serves a specific purpose.

More details on BDD, TDD and ATDD covered by the following resources:

- [Behavior-Driven Development](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/behavior-driven-development/collaboration-with-behavior-driven-development-bdd)
- [BDD in JavaScript](https://www.sitepoint.com/bdd-javascript-cucumber-gherkin/)
- [What does TDD mean for me, the Tester?](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/the-testing-planet-archive/lessons/what-does-tdd-mean-for-me-the-tester)
- [Is Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) Worth the Effort?](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/is-acceptance-test-driven-development-atdd-worth-the-effort)
- [BDD vs TDD vs ATDD : Key Differences](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/tdd-vs-bdd-vs-atdd)

Have a think about how the team is working at the moment and see if it is applying one of these methods.

### 3.2 Automation best practices

Now that you have written some automation tests you will have probably need to refactor some things as well just like you would do during your curriculum as a developer. Look up the following terms and see if you can apply it to your test suite:

- Page objects
- Fixers
- Parametrised tests

## 4. General assessment

This week you will also get a post in the class channel to schedule a time for your general assessment. Read more about it in the [week7 tasks](../week7/MAKEME.md). If no post is up, then poke the Education Director!
