# Week 6

## Sunday meeting
On Sunday our agenda will look as follows:

| Time          | Activity |
| ------------- | -------- |
| 12:00-13:15 | Every team gives a short demo of the feature they built |
| 13:15-13:30 | BREAK |
| 13:30-14:30 | Sprint retrospective |
| 14:30-14:45 | BREAK |
| 14:45-15:30 | Create the list of things to fix before the final version/presentation |

## Week goals
This week is about making the project perfect! This project will be the centerpiece of your CV and should not only work perfectly, but should also look great (both the application as well as the code)! So during the meeting on Sunday, create a list of the things you want to fix. These will probably be smaller issues so unlike previous weeks you will not be assigned features, but will just have a bunch of things to do as a team. 

Think of things like:
- Bugs
- Design improvements
- Code inconsistencies
- Creating custom hooks for shared logic
- Combining components into one or splitting big components into multiple

You will also be preparing a final presentation this week to have on Sunday for everyone that helped you in the project aswell as the HYF core team!
