# Week 7
After the final presentation it is time for the HYF core team to decide who is graduated and who is not. The whole goal of HYF is to get you a junior developer internship and give you the tools to get through it, so to be graduated means that we feel you are able to do that. 

There are four categories the class will be divided up into:
- Graduated without general assessment
- Needs to do a soft skills assessment
- Needs to do a tech skills assessment
- Needs to do a general assessment

For some students, the previous results in the curriculum as well as the performance in the project already has the team convinced that an internship will not be a problem and will graduate without any need of the general assessment.

For others, the feedback from mentors or from soft skills interviews with adyen mean that the team is not 100% convinced. This means that there will be a soft skills assessment section in your general assessment interview. Have a look at the [interview preparation repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation) again to prepare for this.

If your previous technical interviews did not go very well, or you struggled with the code base during the project you will be asked to do another tech skills assessment during you general assessment interview. This is the same structure as all technical interviews in the curriculum, with the final project as the one to demo!

## Failing: What now?
If you do not pass the general assessment it is not the end of the world! The curriculum is hard and sometimes it just takes a little longer. For anyone that does not pass we will set up a tailored plan to work on the parts that you need to improve. The plan really depends on you and what we think you need to improve, but here are some examples as reference:

Example 1: Build 1 or 2 technical assignments from real companies in a defined period of time.
Example 2: Conduct some interviews with HYF mentors to get a second opinion on how we can help you improve your interviewing skills.
Example 3: Redo the graduation project with another class.

If you keep putting in the work, we will continue to support you even after the final project!

## Passing: After the assessment
If you pass, definitely feel free to take a week off. Those were quite the 7 months and you deserve it! 

After that it is important to keep programming though. You should already be in the interview process, but if for some reason there is a scarceness of opportunities, or you are waiting on responses, keep building something. 

If you have an app in mind that you've always wanted to build then this is your chance! If you do not, then choose a technology that you have heard of and build something simple in it to try it out. Developers do this all the time, usually with a chat or todo app as those are the simplest apps to build. 

Some suggestions of technologies (but go for anything that catches your eye):

- Nextjs - build a small app using nextjs (https://nextjs.org/) which is a react framework!
- Angular or Vue.js - widen your frontend knowledge by building an app in an alternative to react
- GraphQL - we teach REST API's but graphql is an alternative and definitely gaining popularity, have a look at [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) and use that
- End-to-end testing - once you have an app, add [cypress](cypress.io) tests to test your application automatically
- [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/) - learn how to test your react code, they provide many really good tutorials on their site

Keep the [technical assignment repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/ta_guidelines) in mind with all these projects though! Potential recruiters will be looking at them and making them look good is important!
